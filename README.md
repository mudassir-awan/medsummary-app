# HapTune: An Open-Source Visual Tool for Designing User-Defined Haptic Signals

**HapTune** is an open-source visual authoring tool that enables no-code creation, editing, and export of mechanical haptic signals. It supports both low-frequency force profiles and high-frequency vibration waveforms, making it ideal for haptic feedback design, robotic control, and virtual texture rendering.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎛️ Visual, no-code interface for **creating and editing** haptic signal waveforms  
* 🔁 Real-time **spline interpolation** and smoothing for precise curve shaping  
* ⬇️ **Downsampling** of exisitng dense waveforms to simplify editing and manual tuning
* 🎚️ Multi-frequency **vibration synthesis** using envelope-based amplitude modulation  
* 📊 Live **frequency spectrum preview** using Fast Fourier transform (FFT)  
* 📁 Import and export of waveform data in **Excel and CSV** formats  
* 🔧 Export-ready signals for deployment on **various haptic and feedback actuators**  
   (e.g., vibration motors, thermal modules, force-feedback systems, voice-coil actuators, electro-tactile displays)


* 💡 Designed for **researchers, engineers, and UI/UX designers** working in haptics and robotics.
