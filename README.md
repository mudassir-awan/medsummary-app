# HapTune: An Open-Source Visual Tool for Designing User-Defined Haptic Signals

**HapTune** is an open-source visual authoring tool that enables no-code creation, editing, and export of mechanical haptic signals. It supports both low-frequency force profiles and high-frequency vibration waveforms, making it ideal for haptic feedback design, robotic control, and virtual texture rendering.
